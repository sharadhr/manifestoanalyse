Foreword
My Fellow Singaporeans,
We have been fighting COVID-19 
since the beginning of this year. 
It has been a hard fight, with all 
hands on deck. We have taken 
strong measures to prevent 
transmission and save lives, 
including the circuit breaker.  
Now, families and friends are 
meeting again, shops and 
restaurants are progressively 
reopening, and businesses 
are resuming work, all with 
precautions. 
Our economy has been severely 
disrupted. We have implemented 
four successive Budgets, injecting 
almost $100 billion, drawing on 
our past reserves. Our goal is 
to help companies, workers and 
households through this very 
difficult period. 
But the crisis is far from over. 
We are in the most severe 
global recession in a century. 
Some companies will not 
survive. Retrenchments and 
unemployment will go up sharply. 
A vaccine is at least a year away, 
and probably longer.
As we sustain our fight against 
COVID-19, our top priority is jobs.  
32
We have mounted a national effort 
to keep people in work, to help 
those out of work find replacement 
jobs, and to create new jobs and 
traineeships both in the public and 
private sectors. 
Post-COVID-19, the world will be very 
different. We must build on what we 
have been doing, to emerge stronger. 
We have been preparing for the 
Future Economy and upgrading 
Singaporeans through SkillsFuture. 
We are improving our city and our 
homes. Whatever your starting point, 
we will make sure you have access 
to good education, healthcare and 
housing, and full opportunities to 
do well. We will always take care of 
the vulnerable in our society, leaving 
no one behind. Through Singapore 
Together, we are engaging the ideas 
and energies of our people to make 
Singapore better. 
In the coming months and years, we 
will face many tough situations and 
difficult decisions. To see ourselves 
through safely, we need a capable 
and committed leadership team, 
working closely with a resolute and 
united people, enjoying full trust 
and confidence in one another. 
The Government needs a fresh 
mandate and a full term ahead of it, 
to act decisively on your behalf, to 
partner you in solving our problems, 
and to fulfil our aspirations too. 
This is why I have called the general 
election now. 
The PAP has always worked with 
you to improve our lives, keep 
everyone safe, and take Singapore 
forward. 
32
Now more than ever, our lives, our 
jobs, our future are all at stake.
Please vote for me and my PAP team. 
Together, we will overcome COVID-19 
and secure a brighter future for 
ourselves and our children.
Yours sincerely
PAP Secretary-General
54
Facing the 
Crisis of 
a Lifetime 
Together
Each of these was a major threat 
to us. Each time, the PAP was 
there – with you, for you and for 
Singapore. Decade after decade, 
we have worked side by side with 
Singaporeans to overcome these 
crises and emerge stronger. 
Covid-19 is our most dangerous crisis 
in more than a generation. This is not 
only a public health crisis but a grave 
and global economic crisis. Many 
jobs will be lost. Some businesses 
will close. Our social resilience will be 
tested.  The road ahead will be tough.
Facing the 
Crisis of a 
Lifetime 
Together
We have weathered many crises together 
as a people and a nation:
· separation from Malaysia in 1965
· the British withdrawal in the 1970s
· the recession of the 1980s
· the Asian Financial Crisis in the 1990s
· 9/11, SARS and the Global Financial 
Crisis in the 2000s
As always, the PAP stands with 
Singaporeans, serving in solidarity.  
We will not let you or Singapore 
down. We will work with you to 
bring everyone safely through the 
storm. We also have clear plans for 
Singapore’s future beyond this crisis. 
We will invest in our people, rebuild 
our economy and strengthen our 
society. Together, we will emerge 
stronger again.
This manifesto sets out our plans for 
Our Lives, Our Jobs, Our Future

Staying 
Safe and 
Healthy 
Together
Public health and safety remains 
an urgent task.
We will: 
· strongly support and equip our 
healthcare professionals and 
frontline agencies to provide 
excellent healthcare for all. We 
are providing free in-patient 
treatment for Covid-19 at public 
hospitals. In total, we have 
allocated $20 billion to MOH in 
the recent budgets
· ramp up Covid-19 testing and 
tracing capabilities
· invest in R&D for Covid-19 
treatments and vaccines, and 
ensure these are available to all 
Singaporeans who need them
To reduce the risk of transmission 
and safeguard public health, we will:
· ensure everyone can obtain 
protective items such as face 
masks
· establish new norms of safe 
interaction for daily living 
· improve public hygiene through 
a major national effort, including 
through the SG Clean campaign
76
We will:
· complete health 
clearance of migrant 
workers and enable 
them to return safely 
to work
· build additional migrant 
worker housing 
with new operating 
models and improved 
standards
76
Creating Jobs 
and Acquiring 
Skills Together
In economic policy, jobs are our top 
priority.
To protect workers from the 
immediate impact of Covid-19, we 
are providing:
· wage subsidies under the Jobs 
Support Scheme (JSS) to help 
you keep your jobs
· income relief to self-employed 
persons and freelancers under 
the Self-Employed Person 
Scheme (SIRS)
· financial assistance to retrenched 
workers or those suffering 
significant income loss under the 
Temporary Relief Scheme (TRS) 
and the Covid-19 Support Grant 
(CSG)
98
With the global and our 
economies hit, we must expect 
business closures and job 
losses. 
We will spare no effort to 
protect and create jobs to keep 
Singaporeans employed.  At 
the same time, we will equip 
you to take advantage of new 
opportunities and growing 
sectors. We:
· set up the National Jobs 
Council to oversee this work
· will create 100,000 new job 
opportunities, comprising 
jobs, traineeships, mid-career 
pathways and courses under 
the SG United Jobs and Skills 
Programme
  
All Workers
To help you access job 
opportunities, we will:
· set up satellite career centres 
in all HDB towns
· scale up programmes for 
career conversion and for 
skills upgrading and mastery 
with the Next Bound of 
SkillsFuture 
· strengthen safeguards for 
jobseekers under the Fair 
Consideration Framework
· provide financial incentives for 
employers to hire or redeploy 
their local workers

and Growing 
Our Economy 
Together

against the immediate 
effects of Covid-19, we are:
· helping with cash flow, 
costs and credit
· passing laws for rental 
relief
· providing extra help to the 
hardest hit sectors like 
aviation, hotels, tourism 
and retail
Beyond the immediate crisis, we 
are preparing for a post Covid-19 
economy. No one knows exactly what 
this will look like. But we have forward 
looking programmes to transform our 
companies and upgrade our workers. 
We will build a dynamic, resilient and 
responsive economy, no matter what 
happens
We will:

co-operation, expand 
our trade networks and 
seek out new markets

economy

healthcare subsidies up to 
80% and CHAS
Providing 
Care and 
Support 
Together
In addition to promoting growth 
and creating jobs so you can 
have good incomes, we will 
provide social and financial 
support when needed.

Pre-Schoolers 
We will make early childhood 
centres Covid-19 safe so that pre-
schoolers can continue to learn 
and be nurtured, and parents can 
work with the assurance their 
children are cared for.
We will:
· enhance subsidies to make pre-
school as affordable as primary 
school 
· increase the government share 
of supported pre-school places 
to 80%, and double the number 
of MOE kindergartens to 60 
· raise pre-school quality through 
the National Institute for Early 
Childhood Education
Special Education 
Needs(SEN)
Families with children with SEN 
need extra support. We will:
· raise awareness of SEN and 
promote greater inclusivity
· make special education more 
affordable
· open new Special Education 
Schools to cater to different 
special needs   
· increase work and care 
options for SEN students 
beyond age 18
1514 15
Students
We are determined not to lose the 
school year, to prevent our students 
from suffering long term harm. We 
will keep schools safe and enable 
learning to continue despite the 
pandemic. 
 
We will:
· provide greater support and 
guidance to students from 
vulnerable backgrounds, who 
are most affected by the crisis
· accelerate the National Digital 
Literacy Programme, including 
bridging the digital divide by 
equipping every secondary 
student with a computing device

(HBL) an integral part of 
education

and skills for a fast-changing 
future

Citizenship Education curriculum

upright and compassionate 
individuals, imbued with mental 
resilience and sound values

expertise of our teachers with

We care for and love our seniors, 
who have contributed so much to 
our nation. We want them to retire 
comfortably with good health. 
To give our seniors greater peace 
of mind, we have provided:

Generation Packages

in retirement with the Matched 
Retirement Savings Scheme, 
enhanced Silver Support, and the 
Silver Housing Bonus and Lease 
Buyback schemes
17
Healthcare
We will expand our healthcare capacity to improve 
access to medical treatment and care for all. 
We will:
· expand the polyclinic network from 20 today to 32 
by 2030, including new polyclinics in Bishan and 
Bidadari
· redevelop the Singapore General Hospital and 
rejuvenate the National University Hospital
· complete the Novena Community Hospital by 
2022 and build a new integrated acute and 
community hospital in the East by 2030
By 2030, one quarter of our population will be 
aged 65 or older. We will have to spend more on 
healthcare to look after our elderly. 
To fund this, the GST has to go up from 7% to 9% 
sometime in the next term of government, but not 
before 2022.
To help Singaporeans to cope with the GST 
increase, we will:
· implement a $6 billion Assurance Package which 
will pay for the GST increase for 5 years for 
most households and 10 years for lower income 
households 
· enhance the GST permanent voucher scheme
· continue to have government absorb GST on 
publicly subsidised healthcare and education
· provide social assistance for those who need 
more help

Building a Strong

four Budgets, using current surpluses and past reserves to support 
Singaporeans through this crisis and prepare for the future. We will 
make this count.  
We will:

Singapore

Living 
Sustainably

how our actions make 
a difference to the 
environment. We will 
make sustainability a 
way of life. 
2120
Building 
Our City 
Together
We have ambitious plans to 
develop Singapore. Covid-19 will 
slow these down but will not stop 
our forward march.  Year by year, 
we will work with you to make 
many projects a reality:
· Smart Nation and the 5G network
· Tuas Megaport 
· Changi T5
· Greater Southern Waterfront and 
Paya Lebar Redevelopment
· Punggol Digital District and 
Jurong Lake District
· Doubling our rail networks with 
the Cross Island Line and the 
Thomson-East Coast Line
Creating a 
New Future 
Together  
Covid-19 has forced a global pause 
and re-set.  At this critical moment 
in human history, we have a unique 
opportunity to re-shape and re-
design our future. 
The PAP 4G leaders launched the 
Singapore Together movement 
for deeper partnership between 
government and Singaporeans, and 
to conceive and implement plans for 
our country.  This has become even 
more vital in a changed world.
We will work with you to chart 
a new direction for Singapore 
in a post-Covid-19 era. We will 
draw on our collective ideas, 
strengths and abilities to:
· emerge stronger as an economy
· emerge stronger as a society
· emerge stronger as a people

unity, resilience, solidarity and 
fortitude. We will work with you to 
seize new opportunities, re-shape 
our future and build a sparkling city 
of tomorrow. We will overcome this 
crisis, triumph over adversity and
